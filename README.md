# Main-Gibbs-Algorithm-
My modified version of the Gibbs algorithm. This Version is able to print up the first 1 billion terms of Ulam numbers, which was not the case previously. The algorithm is optimized with various memory handling making it able to generate other variants of of U(1,n) numbers where n is any positive integers with a calculated magic number
