# Main-Gibbs-Algorithm-
My version of the Gibbs algorithm. This Version is able to print up the first 1 billion terms of Ulam numbers in the less than 1 minute, which was not the case previously. The algorithm is optimized with various memory handling making it able to generate other variants of of U(1,n) numbers where n is any positive integers with a calculated magic number. Together with my instructor, I developed dynamic memory allocation systems that supported scalable storage of large numerical sequences, optimizing access times and reducing overall memory footprint.
